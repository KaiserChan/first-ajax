1) What HTTP method did your browser use to make the request?
<!-- The brower used the "GET" method. -->

2) How many milliseconds did it take your browser to complete it?
<!-- The first request used 62.59 ms -->
<!-- The second request used  29.99 ms -->

3) What HTTP status code did the server return? What does that mean?


4) Look at the "Initiator" and "Type" columns. Was this an xhr/JavaScript/AJAX request or a normal browser request?
